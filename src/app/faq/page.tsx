                    question: "How does Lightning escrow work?",
                    answer: "When you agree to buy something, the buyer sends Bitcoin to a Lightning escrow smart contract. The funds are held securely until the buyer confirms receipt of the item, then automatically released to the seller."

                    question: "Are escrow fees refundable?",
