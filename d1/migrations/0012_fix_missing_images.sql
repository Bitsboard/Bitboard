-- Migration: Fix ALL listings to have exactly 3 images
-- This will ensure every listing has 3 real images, no exceptions

-- Step 1: Add default images for Services listings that are missing image_url
UPDATE listings 
SET image_url = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559136555-9303baea8ebd?w=400&q=80'
WHERE (image_url IS NULL OR image_url = '') AND category = 'Services';

-- Step 2: Add the missing first image (image_order = 0) for all listings that need it
INSERT INTO listing_images (id, listing_id, image_url, image_order, created_at)
SELECT 
  l.id || '_img_0' as id,
  l.id as listing_id,
  l.image_url as image_url,
  0 as image_order,
  strftime('%s', 'now') as created_at
FROM listings l
WHERE l.id IN (
  SELECT listing_id 
  FROM listing_images 
  GROUP BY listing_id 
  HAVING MIN(image_order) > 0
)
AND l.image_url IS NOT NULL 
AND l.image_url != '';

-- Step 3: Add the missing second image (image_order = 1) for listings that only have 2 images
INSERT INTO listing_images (id, listing_id, image_url, image_order, created_at)
SELECT 
  l.id || '_img_1' as id,
  l.id as listing_id,
  CASE l.category
